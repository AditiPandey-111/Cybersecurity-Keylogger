# Cybersecurity-Keylogger
This is a Keylogger project developed by me for educational and ethical use in cybersecurity research. The program captures keystrokes in real time and logs them to a local file for analysis. Itâ€™s designed to help understand how keyloggers work and to demonstrate the importance of secure system practices.
